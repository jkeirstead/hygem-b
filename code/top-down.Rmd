The top-down model uses regression models to estimate the energy consumption of the global buildings sector in 2050.

### Inputs
```{r top-down-inputs, warning=FALSE}
```

### Results

There are three separate top-down models: one calculating global building energy demands in aggregate (**Global**), one calculating building energy demands disaggregated by region (**Regional**), and one with demands disaggregated by both region and fuel (**Fuels**).  It is the **fuels** model which is used to calibrate the bottom-up model.

#### Global 
```{r top-down-global, echo=FALSE}
```
#### Regional
```{r top-down-regional, echo=FALSE}
```
#### Fuels
```{r top-down-fuels, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}
```

#### Summary

```{r top-down-results, results='asis'}
```
