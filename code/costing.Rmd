## Costing

We can now calculate the associated capital and operational costs associated with these technology changes.

```{r costing-config}
## Read in the model components
##
## Each of these files contains named chunks which are then called below.
read_chunk('costing-chunks.r')
```

### Capital costs

#### Space heating 
```{r space-heat-costs, results='asis'}
```

#### Heat pumps
```{r heat-pump-costs, results='asis'}
```

#### Electrical appliance and lighting efficiency
```{r efficiency-costs, results='asis'}
```

#### Other measures
```{r other-costs, results='asis'}
```

### Operationing and fuel costs
The only intervention with an explicit operating cost are the ground-source heat pumps.

```{r heat-pump-operating, results='asis'}
```


### Summary

Total costs and per household costs
